{title:Description}

{pstd}{bf:blopmatching} estimates treatment effects from observational data by blop matching.
blop matching imputes the missing potential outcome for each subject by using a weighted
average of the outcomes of all the subjects that receive the other treatment level.
The vector of weights for each subject is determined by solving a Bi-Level Optimization Problem (BLOP).

{pstd}{space 2}- In the 1st optimization problem, the program finds a set of weights such
that the weighted sum of the observations [note 1] has exactly the same covariate values as the unit to be {p_end}
{pstd}{space 3} matched, when possible, or otherwise their distance is minimized.{p_end}
{pstd}{space 2}- In the 2nd optimization problem, the program implements a
refinement criterion that looks for the weights that minimizes a weighted sum of distances [note 2].

{pstd}Once the weights are determined, 2 treatment effects are calculated:

{pstd}{space 2}- The ATE [note 3] is computed by taking the average of the difference
between the observed and imputed potential outcomes for each subject.{p_end}
{pstd}{space 2}- The ATT [note 4] is computed by taking the average
of the difference between the observed and imputed potential outcomes for each
subject in the treatment group.

{pstd}See {help blopmatching##DRR2015:Rivera et al.(2015)} for more details.

{opt otol}{space 7} Let (P) be a standard LP problem and let c be the current reduced cost.
                    It is well known that if c > 0 the current solution is optimal. {p_end}
{space 5}           However, this rule is impractical due to round-off errors. otol relax this condition to c + otol > 0.
{p 4 4 2}
{opt btol}{space 7} Let (P) be a standard LP problem and let d be the current pivot column.
                    It is well known that if d < 0 the problem is unbounded. {p_end}
{space 5}           However, this rule is impractical due to round-off errors. btol relax this condition to d < btol.

{title:Notes}


{phang}[1] The weights are meant to be positives and sum one, so weighted sums are in fact convex combinations. {p_end}
{phang}[2] It can be shown that each of this 2 problems can be rewritten as a LP. Unfortunately, mata still doesn't have an official LP solver,{p_end}
{phang}{space 3} so we created our own LP solver from scratch. This solver, lpsolver.mata, is an inefficient (but reliable) implementation of the revised simplex algorithm {p_end}
{phang}{space 3} (see {help blopmatching##FMW2007:Ferris et al.(2007)} for more details). {p_end}
{phang}[3] ATE means {it: average treatment effect}. {p_end}
{phang}[4] ATT means {it: average treatment effect on the treated}.
